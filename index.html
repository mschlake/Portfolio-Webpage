  <h3 class="indent">Hi!</h3>

    <h3 class="indent">About me</h3>
    <p>I worked in non-profit youth sport event and program management for almost 15 years. Of the many things I learned, the most important was to never be scared of something new.</p>
    <p>It was this belief that led me to pursue a career in web development. Our organization needed someone to maintain our website, so I volunteered (with zero experience) and fell in love with coding.</p>
    <p>I originally learned basic HTML and CSS through online videos and tutorials. The further I went down the rabbit hole, the more I wanted to learn. This led me to pursue a more structured curriculum in Web Development through Bloc.io.</p>
    <p>Some interesting things about me: I love spending time outdoors (doesn't matter the temperature) with my four dogs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wren</li>
      <li>Beau</li>
      <li>Link</li>
      <li>Nova</li>
    </ol>
    <p>They spend weekdays chasing each other around the house anxiously awaiting the weekend to go hiking and exploring new place!</p>
